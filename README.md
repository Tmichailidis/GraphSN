GraphSN (Graph Single Node) is the implementation of an efficient disk-based system for Large-scale graph computations/graph analysis on a single node. This was my undergraduate thesis project.

- Currently, it supports only edgelist format.
- Sources connectedcomponents.cpp and shortestdistance.cpp contain examples of usage.
- Files "facebook" and "youtube" are two input graphs in edgelist format. More in https://snap.stanford.edu/snap/
